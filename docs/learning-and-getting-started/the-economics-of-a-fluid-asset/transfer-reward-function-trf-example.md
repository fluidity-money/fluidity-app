# ✏ Transfer Reward Function (TRF) Example

{% hint style="success" %}
This is a sample example of the TRF in action and how the rewards and expected outcomes change.
{% endhint %}

### High to average transaction fee chain and protocols:

As an example Fluidity provides the following numbers for a $50M reward pool with 80,000 daily fluid transactions, an average gas fee of $3 and six tiers of rewards:

{% hint style="info" %}
_Note: the sending party receives 80% and the receiving party receives 20% of the rewards._
{% endhint %}

| Probability (%) | Reward Received ($) |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| 42.66           | 0.62                |
| 15.69           | 1.69                |
| 2.39            | 11.06               |
| 0.15            | 176.89              |
| 3.23e-3         | 8181.33             |
| 1.41e-5         | 1,865,342.25        |

As can be seen in the example above, **over half of all transactions receive 60 cents up to $1.70, one in every 650 transactions receives $180, and four times a year users can receive $1.8M!**

{% hint style="info" %}
If you pay a higher gas fee, you will have a higher expected outcome of winning a larger prize, although this caps at the APY %, so paying an extremely large gas fee does not guarantee a 100% win chance.
{% endhint %}

### Low transaction fee chain and operating protocols on top:

What if you were to use a chain that had low transaction fees?&#x20;

Every event where you send a transaction and there is a difference between senders and receivers in the transaction run all counts in theory as a transaction fee. Let's use Solana as an example.

Setting similar parameters as the previous example with some modifications:&#x20;

* $1B in TVL
* 3.5% APY
* 50K Daily TXs
* Solana Gas Fee: $0.00025.\

* **Saber $1000 Swap**
  * Solana Gas Fee: $0.00025 + 0.04% Saber fee = $0.4 fee.
* **Solanart $100 NFT Purchase**
  * Solana Gas Fee: $0.00025 + 3% Solanart fee = $3 fee.

If you were to do a transaction on top of these protocols will get a similar transaction probability reward metric as above.

So in essence, by doing a Saber trade or a Solanart, a user has the **same probability of being rewarded millions through Fluid Assets as they do on high gas chains.**
