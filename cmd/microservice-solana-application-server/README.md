# microservice-solana-application-server

Processes transactions that have been tagged with application events,
sending them to the worker with additional information attached.

Supported contracts:
 - Saber

## Integrating a new application

Update the list above with the name of the application!
Then, update:

 - `common/solana/applications/applications.go`

 Add `Application<name>` to the `Applications` enum. Add `"name": Application<name>` to the `applicationNames` map.

 - `cmd/microservice-solana-application-server/lib/<name>/`

 Add a folder for your application, and add code to calculate the app fee (and sender/receiver, if necessary).

 - `cmd/microservice-solana-application-server/main.go`

 Add code to the switch in `parseTransaction` to call your calculation function.

Update the environment variable `FLU_SOLANA_APPLICATIONS_LIST` in microservice-solana-transactions to include `name:address`, where `name` is your application's name and `address` is a solana account that will be included in relevant transactions. If your application has multiple addresses, specify `name:address,name:address2,etc`.
