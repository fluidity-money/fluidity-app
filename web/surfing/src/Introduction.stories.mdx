    Surfing is Fluidity's beautiful new design language. <br />
    Designed to flow.

## Start Surfing

Getting started is easy.

If you're developing for Fluidity, simply install the package and start using it.

```bash
npm install --save ../surfing
```

This assumes that you're using the mono-repo setup.
Otherwise, you'll need to install the package separately.

Post launch, you should simply be able to use `@fluidity/surfing` in your project. Pending approval of course!

## Development setup

You're already here! We use Storybook to develop our components.

Vite should just build the components for you.
