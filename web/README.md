# Welcome Web Developer! ðŸ’¡

We have some projects in here to keep our monorepo nice and tidy.
I'll give you the tour.

- Surfing is our UI library, it keeps the pages looking glossy.
- Project fluidity.money is our landing page.
- Project app.fluidity.money is our system's main point of access.

## Setup

We're using turborepo here so just use:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

in _this_ folder and it should all be live.

## Package management

Is it a shared package such as React? An `yarn add` in the root should do.
If your package manager is new enough to be workspace aware, (we'd hope so in this case)
`yarn add` in the directory of the application.

Alternatively you can use the more powerful `--workspace` flag.

## Usage

Current commands:

**Turborepo**

- yarn build
- yarn test
- yarn dev
- yarn storybook

To use turborepo options behind these, e.g filter use the following syntax.

```sh
yarn build --filter=surfing
```

**Prettier**

- yarn format

## Creating a new package

**Great!** This monorepo tech exists to make package creation and code sharing painless.

Currently we _aren't_ following the best practice for directory structure as a layover from before.

Simply use your scaffolder, I like create-vite. Then add your project to the `web` folder's `package.json` as a workspace.

Run a `yarn` and it should be good to go!

Before you go, chuck a brief description of your app in this file.
It really helps people get their bearings around the code here.

Have fun!
