# Welcome Web Developer! ðŸ’¡

We have some projects in here to keep our monorepo nice and tidy.
I'll give you the tour.

- Surfing is our UI library, it keeps the pages looking glossy.
- Project fluidity.money is our landing page.
- Project app.fluidity.money is our system's main point of access.

We're using turborepo here so just use:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

in _this_ folder and it should all be live.
